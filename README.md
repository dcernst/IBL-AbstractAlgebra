## Overview
hese notes are an IBL task sequence for an undergraduate abstract algebra course that emphasizes visualization. The task-sequence was written by [Dana Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) (Northern Arizona University). Any errors in the notes are no one's fault but my own. In this vein, if you think you see an error, please [inform me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu), so that it can be remedied. Very much a work in progress.
