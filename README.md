# An Inquiry-Based Approach to Abstract Algebra #

## Warning

During the Spring 2018 semester, I will be making substantial changes to the version of the notes in the ConstructionZone directory. For more details, see the README file in the ConstructionZone directory.  The version of the notes in the Fall2017 directory are battled-tested and good to go.

## Overview
This free and open-source textbook was written by me ([Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com)) and is designed to used with an [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) approach to a first-semester undergraduate abstract algebra course. The textbook starts with groups (up to the First Isomorphism Theorem) and finishes with an introduction to rings (up to quotients by maximal and prime ideals). While the textbook covers many of the standard topics, the focus is on building intuition and emphasizes visualization.
