# An Inquiry-Based Approach to Abstract Algebra #

## Warning

During the Spring 2018 semester, I will be making substantial changes to the version of the notes in the ConstructionZone directory. For more details, see the README file in the ConstructionZone directory.  The version of the notes in the Fall2017 directory are battled-tested and good to go.

## Overview
These notes are an IBL task sequence for an undergraduate abstract algebra course that emphasizes visualization. The task-sequence was written by me ([Dana Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io)). I would be thrilled if you used these notes and improved them.  If you make any modifications, you can either make a pull request on GitHub or submit the improvements to me via email.
