# Overview #
These notes are an IBL task sequence for an abstract algebra course that emphasizes visualization and incorporates technology. The task-sequence was written by [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (Northern Arizona University). Any errors in the notes are no one's fault but my own. In this vein, if you think you see an error, please [inform me](mailto:dana@danaernst.com), so that it can be remedied. Very much a work in progress.
