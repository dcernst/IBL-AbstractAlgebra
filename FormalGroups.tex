\chapter{A Formal Approach to Groups}
\label{chapter:formal_groups}
\thispagestyle{empty}

In this chapter we finally introduce the formal definition of a group.  From this point on, our focus will shift from developing intuition to studying the abstract properties of groups.  However, we should not abandon the intuition we have gained.  As we progress, your intuitive understanding of groups will continue to improve and you should rely on this understanding as you try to make sense of the notions that follow.  There has been plenty of intentional foreshadowing, so expect to revisit concepts you've already encountered.  We'll also encounter plenty of new stuff, too.

It is important to point out that things are about to get quite a bit more difficult for most of you.  Be patient and persistent!

\begin{section}{Binary Operations}
After learning to count as a child, you likely learned how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide with natural numbers.  Loosely speaking, these operations are examples of binary operations since we are combining two objects to obtain a single object.  More formally, we have the following definition.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{binary operation} $*$ on a set $A$ is a function from $A\times A$ into $A$.  For each $(a,b)\in A\times A$, we denote the element $*(a,b)$ via $a*b$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Don't misunderstand the use of $*$ in this context.  We are not implying that $*$ is the ordinary multiplication of real numbers that you are familiar with.  We use $*$ to represent a generic binary operation.  
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Notice that since the codomain of a binary operation on a set $A$ is $A$, binary operations require that we yield an element of $A$ when combining two elements of $A$.  In this case, we say that $A$ is \textbf{closed} under $*$.  Binary operations have this closure property by definition.  Also, since binary operations are functions, any attempt to combine two elements from $A$ should result in a \emph{unique} element of $A$.  In this case, we say that $*$ is \textbf{well-defined}.  Moreover, since the domain of $*$ is $A\times A$, it must be the case that $*$ is defined for \emph{all} pairs of elements from $A$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
Examples of binary operations include $+$ (addition), $-$ (subtraction), and $\cdot$ (multiplication) on the real numbers.  However, $\div$ (division) is not a binary operation on the set of real numbers because all elements of the form $(a,0)$ are not in the domain $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ since we cannot divide by 0.  Yet, $\div$ is a suitable binary operation on $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $C$ be the set of continuous functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.  Then $\circ$ (function composition) is a binary operation on $C$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the 6 actions of $D_3$.  The composition of these actions is a binary operation on $D_3$.  In fact, composition of actions for each of the groups that we have seen is a binary operation on the given group.  Notice that we never used a symbol for these binary operations, but rather used juxtaposition (i.e., $ab$ is the juxtaposition of $a$ and $b$).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of $2\times 2$ matrices with real number entries.  Then matrix multiplication is a binary operation on $M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R})$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Explain why composition of spins is not a binary operation on the set of allowable spins in $\Spin_{3\times 3}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Let $M(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of matrices (of any size) with real number entries.  Is matrix addition a binary operation on $M(\mathbb{R})$?  How about matrix multiplication?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Determine whether $\cup$ (union) and $\cap$ (intersection) are binary operations on $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z})$ (i.e., the power set of the integers).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the closed interval $[0,1]$ and define $*$ on $[0,1]$ via $a*b=\mathrm{min}\{a,b\}$ (i.e., take the minimum of $a$ and $b$).  Determine whether $*$ is a binary operation on $[0,1]$.
\end{exercise}

Some binary operations have additional properties.

\begin{definition}
Let $A$ be a set and let $*$ be a binary operation on $A$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $*$ is \textbf{associative} if and only if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$ for all $a,b,c\in A$.
\item We say that $*$ is \textbf{commutative} if and only if $a*b=b*a$ for all $a,b\in A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
Provide at least one example of a binary operation and the corresponding set that is commutative.  How about not commutative?
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}
Let $A$ be a set and let $F$ be the set of functions from $A$ to $A$.  Then function composition is an associative binary operation on $F$.
\end{theorem}

When the set $A$ is finite, we can represent a binary operation on $A$ using a table in which the elements of the set are listed across the top and the left side (in the same order).  The entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the table represents the output of combining the element that labels the $i$th row with the element that labels the $j$th column (order matters).

\begin{example}\label{example:table}
Consider the following table.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c}
$*$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$a$ & $b$ & $c$ & $b$ \\
\hline $b$ & $a$ & $c$ & $b$  \\
\hline $c$ & $c$ & $b$ & $a$
\end{tabu}
\end{center}
This table represents a binary operation on the set $A=\{a,b,c\}$.  In this case, $a*b=c$ while $b*a=a$.  This shows that $*$ is not commutative.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
What property must a table for a binary operation have in order for the operation to be commutative?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{exer:table_missing_entries}%Exercise 1.2.6 in Fraleigh
Fill in the missing entries in the following table so that $*$ defines an associative binary operation on $\{a,b,c,d\}$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
    $*$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ & $d$ \\\tabucline[2pt]{-}
    $a$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ & $d$ \\\hline
    $b$ & $b$ & $a$ & $c$ & $d$ \\\hline
    $c$ & $c$ & $d$ & $c$ & $d$ \\\hline
    $d$ &  &  & & 
\end{tabu}
\end{center}
\end{exercise}

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Groups}
Without further ado, here is our official definition of a group.

\begin{definition}\label{def:group}
A group $(G,*)$ is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $*$ such that the following axioms hold.
\begin{description}
\item[Axiom 0.] The set $G$ is closed under $*$.
\item[Axiom 1.] The operation $*$ is associative.
\item[Axiom 2.] There is an element $e\in G$ such that for all $g\in G$, $e*g=g*e=g$.  We call $e$ the \textbf{identity}.
\item[Axiom 3.] Corresponding to each $g\in G$, there is an element $g'\in G$ such that $g*g'=g'*g=e$.  In this case, $g'$ is called the \textbf{inverse} of $g$, which we shall denote as $g^{-1}$.
\end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
A few comments are in order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Notice that a group has two parts to it, namely, a set and a binary operation.  For simplicity, if $(G,*)$ is a group, we will often refer to $G$ as being the group.  However, you must remember that the binary operation is part of the structure.
\item Axiom 2 forces $G$ to be nonempty.
\item In the generic case, even if $*$ is not actually multiplication, we will refer to $a*b$ as the product of $a$ and $b$.
\item We are not requiring $*$ to be commutative.  If $*$ is commutative, then we say that $G$ is \textbf{abelian}\footnote{Commutative groups are called abelian in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel (1802--1829).} (or \textbf{commutative}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
Explain why Axiom 0 is unnecessary.
\end{exercise}

At this time, we have two definitions of a group.  The first one was intended to provide an intuitive introduction and Definition~\ref{def:group} provides a rigorous mathematical definition.  We should confirm that these two definitions are in fact compatible.

\begin{exercise}
Compare and contrast our two definitions of a group.  How do the rules and axioms match up?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Quickly verify that $\Spin_{1\times 3}$, $S_2$, $R_4$, $D_3$, $D_4$, $V_4$, and $Q_8$ are groups under composition of actions.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Determine whether each of the following are groups.  If the pair is a group, determine whether it is abelian and identify the identity.  Explain your answers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $(\mathbb{Z},+)$
\item[(b)] $(\mathbb{N},+)$
\item[(c)] $(\mathbb{Z},\cdot)$
\item[(d)] $(\mathbb{R},+)$
\item[(e)] $(\mathbb{R},\cdot)$
\item[(f)] $(\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\},\cdot)$
\item[(g)] $(M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R}),+)$
\item[(h)] $(M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R}),*)$, where $*$ is matrix multiplication.
\item[(i)] $(\{a,b,c\},*)$, where $*$ is the operation determined by the table in Example~\ref{example:table}.
\item[(j)] $(\{a,b,c,d\},*)$, where $*$ is the operation determined by the table in Exercise~\ref{exer:table_missing_entries}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Notice that in Axiom 2 of Definition~\ref{def:group}, we said \emph{the} identity and not \emph{an} identity.  Implicitly, this implies that the identity is unique.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:unique_id}
Let $G$ be a group with binary operation $*$.  Then there is a unique identity element in $G$.  That is, there is only one element $e$ in $G$ such that $g*e=e*g=g$ for all $g\in G$.
\end{theorem}

The following theorem is crucial for proving many theorems about groups.

\begin{theorem}[Cancellation Law]
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g,x,y\in G$.  Then $g*x=g*y$ if and only if $x=y$.  Similarly, $x*g=y*g$ if and only if $x=y$.\footnote{You only need to prove one of these statements as the proof of the other is symmetric.}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
Show that $(\mathbb{R},\cdot)$ fails the Cancellation Law (confirming the fact that it is not a group).
\end{exercise}

\begin{corollary}
Let $G$ be a group with binary operation $*$.  Then each $g\in G$ has a unique inverse.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:unique_soln}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g,h\in G$.  Then the equations $g*x=h$ and $y*g=h$ have unique solutions for $x$ and $y$ in $G$.  
\end{theorem}

While proving the previous few theorems, hopefully one of the things you realized is that you can multiply both sides of a group equation by the same element but that you have to do it on the same side of each half.  That is, since a group may or may not be abelian, if I multiply one side of an equation on the left by a group element, then we must multiply the other side of the equation on the left by the same group element.

Despite the fact that a group may or may not be abelian, if one product is equal to the identity, then reversing the order yields the same result.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a group with binary operation $*$.  If $g*h=e$, then $h*g=e$.
\end{theorem}

The upshot of the previous theorem is if we have a ``left inverse" then we automatically have a ``right inverse" (and vice versa).

The next theorem should not be surprising.

\begin{theorem}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g\in G$.  Then $(g^{-1})^{-1}=g$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g\in G$.  Then for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we define
\[
g^n=\underbrace{g*g*\cdots *g}_{n\text{ factors}}
\]
and
\[
g^{-n}=\underbrace{g^{-1}*g^{-1}*\cdots *g^{-1}}_{n\text{ factors}}.
\]
Moreover, we define $g^0=e$.
\end{definition}

The good news is that the rules of exponents you are familiar with still hold for groups.

\begin{theorem}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $g\in G$.  If $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g^n*g^m=g^{n+m}$,
\item $(g^n)^{-1}=g^{-n}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Group Tables}
Recall that we could represent a binary operation on a finite set using a table.  Since groups have binary operations at their core, we can represent a finite group (i.e., a group with finitely many elements) using a table, called a \textbf{group table}. For example, the following is a group table for $V_4$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & $v$ & $h$ & $vh$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ & $e$ & $v$ & $h$ & $vh$ \\
\hline $v$ & $v$ & $e$ & $vh$ & $h$  \\
\hline $h$ & $h$ & $vh$ & $e$ & $v$\\
\hline $vh$ & $vh$ & $h$ & $v$ & $e$
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that $V_4$ is an abelian group.  What feature of the group table makes this clear?
\end{exercise}

Notice that above I said, ``a group table for $V_4$" and not ``the group table."  The reason for this is that if we chose a different order of the elements (e.g., swap rows 1 and 4---which swaps columns 1 and 4, as well), then the table would look slightly different.  Also, if we had chosen a different generating set, then the names of the elements would look different.  Regardless, the table still captures the same information about the binary operation.

\begin{exercise}
Create group tables for the following groups: $S_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$, $D_3$, $S_3$, $D_4$, and $Q_8$.  Which groups are abelian?
\end{exercise}

Perhaps you noticed when creating the tables above that each element of the group appeared exactly once in each row and column, respectively.  This is true, in general.  Use Theorem~\ref{thm:unique_soln}, to prove the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
Let $(G,*)$ be a finite group.  Then each element of $G$ appears exactly once in each row and each column, respectively, in any group table for $G$.
\end{theorem}

We can also use tables to define groups.  For example, consider the following table on the set $A=\{e,a,b,c\}$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\
\hline $a$ & $a$ & $e$ & $c$ & $b$  \\
\hline $b$ & $b$ & $c$ & $e$ & $a$\\
\hline $c$ & $c$ & $b$ & $a$ & $e$
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\noindent Is this a table for a group?  First, we see that the binary operation determined by the table is closed.  Second, we see that $e$ is acting as the identity.  Since every row and column has the identity element $e$ appearing, we know that every element has an inverse (do you see why that follows?).  The only thing left to check is associativity.  Imagine for a moment what this entails.  It's messy right?!  And this is only for a group of order 4.

Thankfully, we can rely on some prior knowledge to help out with associativity.  It turns out that if you look closely, the group table for $V_4$ looks the ``same" as the table above.  What do we mean by ``same" here?  The names for elements are different (except for $e$), but 
\begin{quotation}
\emph{the product of corresponding elements yields the corresponding results.}
\end{quotation}
To see what I mean, let's color both tables with white, red, blue, and green in such a way that each element corresponds to a unique color.  If we choose our colors wisely, it is easy to see that both tables have the same structure.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$v$ & \cellcolor{blue}$h$ & \cellcolor{green}$vh$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$v$ & \cellcolor{blue}$h$ & \cellcolor{green}$vh$ \\
\hline \cellcolor{red}$v$ & \cellcolor{red}$v$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{green}$vh$ & \cellcolor{blue}$h$  \\
\hline \cellcolor{blue}$h$ & \cellcolor{blue}$h$ & \cellcolor{green}$vh$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$v$\\
\hline \cellcolor{green}$vh$ & \cellcolor{green}$vh$ & \cellcolor{blue}$h$ & \cellcolor{red}$v$ & $e$
\end{tabu}
\hspace{1cm}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$a$ & \cellcolor{blue}$b$ & \cellcolor{green}$c$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$a$ & \cellcolor{blue}$b$ & \cellcolor{green}$c$ \\
\hline \cellcolor{red}$a$ & \cellcolor{red}$a$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{green}$c$ & \cellcolor{blue}$b$  \\
\hline \cellcolor{blue}$b$ & \cellcolor{blue}$b$ & \cellcolor{green}$c$ & $e$ & \cellcolor{red}$a$\\
\hline \cellcolor{green}$c$ & \cellcolor{green}$c$ & \cellcolor{blue}$b$ & \cellcolor{red}$a$ & $e$
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\noindent Since we already know that $V_4$ is a group, we know that the binary operation for $V_4$ is associative.  

\begin{exercise}
Explain why the discussion above implies that the binary operation determined by the table on the right above must be associative.  Have we shown that $(A,*)$ is a group?
\end{exercise}

It is important to point out that if we had not chosen our colors wisely, then perhaps the colorings of the two tables would not agree.  Moreover, if we had made the same color choices for elements, but then rearranged columns and rows of one table, the colorings of the two tables would not agree.  This doesn't imply anything.  The point is whether we \emph{can} get the tables to match.

\begin{exercise}
Draw the Cayley diagram for $(A,*)$ with generators $a$ and $b$.  Explain why this implies that $V_4$ and $A$ (under their respective binary operations) are isomorphic.  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Is it possible to color the group table for $R_4$ so that it matches the coloring of $V_4$?  Explain your answer.
\end{exercise}

\begin{problem}
Let $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ be two finite groups.  Suppose we can arrange the rows and columns and color elements in such a way that the colorings for the two group tables agree.  Explain why this implies that the two groups are isomorphic.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Suppose we have a table for $(G,*)$, where $G$ is finite.  Further suppose that (i) there is an identity element, and (ii) every element appears exactly once in each row and column, respectively.  Explain why the only thing we need to verify in order for $(G,*)$ to be a group is that $*$ is associative.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}%Exercise 4.18 in VGT
Suppose that $(G,*)$ is a group.  Theorem~\ref{thm:unique_id} guarantees that there is a unique identity in $G$.  When creating the group table for $G$, what goes wrong if you try to include two different identity elements?
\end{problem}

Consider the class of all possible groups.  It turns out that ``isomorphic" ($\cong$) determines an equivalence relation.  That is, under this relation two groups are related if and only if they are isomorphic.  We'll prove this formally later when we have a more rigorous definition of isomorphic.

\begin{problem}
Explain why all groups with a single element are isomorphic.
\end{problem}

In this case, we say that ``up to isomorphism" there is only one group with a single element.

\begin{problem}
Consider a group $(G,*)$ of order 2.  Suppose that $G=\{e,a\}$.  Complete the following group table for $G$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & $a$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ &  &  \\
\hline $a$ &  & 
\end{tabu}
\end{center}
Explain why every group with 2 elements must be isomorphic to $S_2$.
\end{problem}

The previous problem implies that up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 2.

\begin{problem}
Consider a group $(G,*)$ of order 3.  Suppose that $G=\{e,a,b\}$.  Complete the following group table for $G$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ &  &  & \\
\hline $a$ &  & & \\
\hline $b$ &  & &
\end{tabu}
\end{center}
Explain why every group with 3 elements must be isomorphic to $R_3$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider a group $(G,*)$ of order 4.  Suppose that $G=\{e,a,b,c\}$.  Assuming that $e$ is the identity, the first row and first column of the corresponding group table must be completed as follows.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabu}{c|[2pt]c|c|c|c}
$*$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\ \tabucline[2pt]{-}
$e$ &  $e$ & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\
\hline $a$ & $a$ & ? & & \\
\hline $b$ & $b$ & & & \\
\hline $c$ & $c$ & & &
\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\noindent The cell with the question mark cannot be filled with an $a$.  So, this entry must be either $e$, $b$, or $c$.  However, it should be easy to see the cases with $b$ and $c$ are symmetric.  Thus, there are two cases: (i) the entry with the question mark is filled with $e$, (ii) the entry with the question mark is (without loss of generality) filled with $b$.  Complete the group table in each of these two cases.  Recall that we've seen two non-isomorphic groups of order 2, namely $R_4$ and $V_4$.  What conclusion can you make about groups of order 4?
\end{problem}

So far we've seen that there are unique groups up to isomorphism of orders 1, 2, and 3, but that there are two groups up to isomorphism of order 4.  A general question we will want to address is, how many groups are there of order $n$?

In a future chapter we will be able to prove that there is only one group up to isomorphism of order 5, namely those groups isomorphic to $R_5$ (i.e., rotation group of a regular pentagon).

We've seen three groups of order 6, namely $R_6$, $D_3$, and $S_3$.  However, $D_3\cong S_3$ (see Problem \ref{prob:D3_iso_S3}) while $R_6$ is not isomorphic to either of these (see Problem \ref{prob:R6_not_iso_D3}).  So, we can conclude that there are at least two groups up to isomorphism of order 6.   But are there others?  It turns out that the answer is yes, but why?

The group $R_7$ is the group of rotations of a regular 7-sided polygon.  This group has order 7.  Are there other groups of order 7 that are not isomorphic to $R_7$? 

We've encountered four groups of order 8, namely $D_4$, $\Spin_{1\times 2}$, $Q_8$, and $R_8$.  Of these, only $D_4$ and $\Spin_{1\times 2}$ are isomorphic.  Thus, there are at least three groups up to isomorphism of order 8.  However, are these the only ones?  It turns out that the answer is no.  What are the missing ones?

\begin{section}{Revisiting Cayley Diagrams and Our Original Definition of a Group}%This section closely mimics Section 6.1 in VGT

Let's begin with a couple exercises.

\begin{exercise}\label{exer:nonregular1}%Exercise 4.16 in VGT
Consider the following diagram that we saw at the end of Chapter~\ref{chapter:cayley_diagrams}.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{nonregular.png}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Consider Rules 1--4 of our original definition of a group (see Definition~\ref{def:informal_group}).  Does the above diagram satisfy Rules 1--4?
\item[(b)] Try to convert this diagram into a group table.  Does the table represent a group? What goes wrong?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{exer:nonregular2}%Exercise 4.16 in VGT
Consider the following diagram.

\tikzstyle{vert} = [circle, draw, fill=grey,inner sep=0pt, minimum size=4mm]
\tikzstyle{b} = [draw,very thick,blue,stealth-stealth]
\tikzstyle{r} = [draw, very thick, red,-stealth]

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto]

\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Does the above diagram satisfy Rules 1--4 of Definition~\ref{def:informal_group}?
\item[(b)] Try to convert this diagram into a group table.  Does the table represent a group? What goes wrong?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

As the previous two exercises indicate, the moral of the story is that our original intuitive definition of a group has a weakness.  It does not agree with our formal definition of a group given in Definition~\ref{def:group}.  Let's see if we can figure out what goes wrong.

Consider the Cayley diagram for $D_3$ with generators $r$ and $s$.

\tikzstyle{vert} = [circle, draw, fill=grey,inner sep=0pt, minimum size=8mm]
\tikzstyle{h} = [draw,very  thick, blue,stealth-stealth]
\tikzstyle{r} = [draw, very thick, red,-stealth]

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75,auto]
\node (e) at (90:2) [vert] {$e$};
\node (r) at (-30:2) [vert] {$r$};
\node (rr) at (210:2) [vert] {$r^2$};
\node (h) at (90:4) [vert] {$s$};
\node (hr) at (210:4) [vert] {$rs$};

\noindent Notice that we labeled the lower right corner of the Cayley diagram with the word $r^2s$.  This means that we first followed a blue arrow out of $e$ and then two red arrows.  However, we could also get to this vertex by first doing a red arrow out of $e$ followed by a blue arrow.  So, we could also have labeled this vertex with the word $sr$.  The upshot is that $r^2s=sr$.  These types of group equations are called \textbf{relations}.

We discovered this relation by starting at $e$ and then traveling a sequence of arrows to get to the vertex in the lower right corner.  However, notice that following a blue and then two red arrows is \emph{always} the same as following a red arrow and then a blue arrow regardless of which vertex we start at.  That is, the relation $r^2s=sr$ holds universally across the entire Cayley diagram.

Cayley diagrams for groups will always have this uniform symmetry.  The fancy way of saying this is that Cayley diagrams are \textbf{regular}.  In other words, a diagram is regular if every internal pattern repeats itself throughout the diagram.

\begin{exercise}
Identify two other relations that the above Cayley diagram for $D_3$ exhibits.  Find one that involves both $r^{-1}$ (i.e., following a red arrow backwards) and $s$.  Convince yourself that your relations appear throughout the diagram.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that the diagrams in Exercise~\ref{exer:nonregular1} and \ref{exer:nonregular2} are not regular.
\end{exercise}

\begin{problem}
Explain why the Cayley diagram for a group must be regular.
\end{problem}

The discussion and exercises above lead us to conclude that one thing missing from our original intuitive definition of a group is regularity.  It turns out that this is the only thing missing.  That is, if we add the requirement of regularity to our intuitive definition, we could convert it into a rigorous definition that is equivalent to Definition~\ref{def:group}.  However, we won't bother doing this since our intuitive definition served its purpose.

\begin{section}{Revisiting Subgroups}

Back in Section~\ref{sec:intuitive_subgroups}, we introduced the notion of subgroup.  In light of our official definition of a group, we more or less have the same definition as before, but let's restate it here using slightly more formal language.

\begin{definition}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $H$ be a subset of $G$.  Then $H$ is a \textbf{subgroup} of $G$, written $H\leq G$, provided that $H$ is a group in its own right under the binary operation inherited from $G$.
\end{definition}

The phrase ``under the binary operation inherited from $G$" means that to combine two elements in $H$, we should treat the elements as if they were in $G$ and perform $G$'s binary operation.

Recall that Theorems~\ref{thm:trivial_subgroup1} and \ref{thm:trivial_subgroup2} tell us that $\langle e\rangle=\{e\}$ and $G$ are always subgroups of $G$. This is still true even using our official definition of a group.  These two subgroups are referred to as the \textbf{trivial subgroups}\footnote{Some textbooks will refer to $\{e\}$ as being the trivial subgroup and $G$ as the improper subgroup.}.  All other subgroups are called \textbf{nontrivial}.  If $H$ is a nontrivial subgroup of a group $G$, then we may write $H<G$.

Using our unofficial definition of a group, Theorem~\ref{thm:informal_subgroup_criterion} told us that a subset $H$ of a group $G$ was a subgroup if it satisfied Rules 2 and 4.  The theorem below is the analogous statement for our official definition of a group.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $(G,*)$ is a group and $H\subseteq G$.  Then $H\leq G$ if and only if (i) $H$ for all $h\in H$, $h^{-1} \in H$, as well, and (ii) $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
Consider $(\mathbb{R}^3,+)$, where $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the set of all 3-entry row vectors with real number entries (e.g., $(a,b,c)$ where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$) and $+$ is ordinary vector addition.  It turns out that $(\mathbb{R}^3,+)$ is an abelian group with identity $(0,0,0)$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Let $H$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of vectors with first coordinate 0.  Is $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^3$?  Prove your answer.
\item[(b)] Let $K$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of vectors whose entries sum to 0.  Is $K$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^3$?  Prove your answer.
\item[(c)] Construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ (different from $H$ and $K$) that is \emph{not} a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{exer:nZ}
Consider the group $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ (under ordinary addition).
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Show that the even integers, written $2\mathbb{Z}:=\{2k:k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$, form a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$.
\item[(b)] Show that the odd integers are not a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$.
\item[(c)] Show that all subsets of the form $n\mathbb{Z}:=\{nk:k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ are subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$.
\item[(d)] Are there any other subgroups besides the ones listed in part (c)?  Explain your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the group of symmetries of a regular octagon.  This group is denoted by $D_8$, where the operation is composition of actions.  The group $D_8$ consists of 16 elements (8 rotations and 8 reflections).  Let $H$ be the subset consisting of the following clockwise rotations: $0^\circ$, $90^\circ$, $180^\circ$, and $270^\circ$.  Determine whether $H$ is a subgroup of $D_8$ and justify your answer.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the groups $(\mathbb{R},+)$ and $(\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\},\cdot)$.  Explain why $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ is not a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$ despite the fact that $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and both are groups.
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $(G,*)$ is a group and let $H,K\leq G$.  Then $H\cap K\leq G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
Can we replace intersection with union in the theorem above?  If so, prove the corresponding theorem.  If not, then provide a specific counterexample.
\end{problem}

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $(G,*)$ is a group.  Define
\[
Z(G):=\{z\in G:zg=gz\text{ for all } g\in G\}
\]
(called the \textbf{center} of $G$).  Then $Z(G)$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$.
\end{theorem}

The following definition formalizes Definition~\ref{def:subgroup_gen_by}.

\begin{definition}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $S$ be a nonempty subset of $G$.  Then we define $\langle S\rangle$ to be the set consisting of all possible (finite) products of elements from $S$ and their inverses.  The set $\langle S\rangle$ is called the \textbf{subgroup generated by $S$}.  The elements of $S$ are called \textbf{generators} of $\langle S\rangle$.
\end{definition}

Note that $S$ may be finite or infinite.  Moreover, even if $S$ is finite, $\langle S\rangle$ may be infinite.  Also, it is important to point out that we are not putting any restrictions about efficiency on $S$ in the definition above.  That is, it is possible that some elements are included in $S$ that are not necessary to generate all of the elements of $\langle S\rangle$.

In cases when we know what the elements of $S$ actually are, then we will list them inside the angle brackets without the set braces.  For example, if $S=\{a,b,c\}$, then we will write $\langle a, b, c\rangle$ instead of $\langle \{a,b,c\}\rangle$.  In the special case when $S$ equals a single element, say $S=\{a\}$, then
\[
\langle a\rangle =\{a^n:n\in\mathbb{Z}\},
\]
which is called the \textbf{subgroup generated by $a$}.  

The set $\langle S\rangle$ is called the ``subgroup generated by $S$", so it better be a subgroup!

\begin{theorem}
Let $(G,*)$ be a group and let $S\subseteq G$.  Then $\langle S\rangle \leq G$.  Moreover, $\langle S\rangle$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
In Exercise~\ref{exer:nZ} we introduced the notation $n\mathbb{Z}$.  Write these subgroups in the ``generated by" notation.  That is, find a set $S$ such that $\langle S\rangle =n\mathbb{Z}$.  Can you find more than one way to do it?
\end{exercise}

Every subgroup can be written in the ``generated by" form.  That is, if $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$, then there always exists a subset $S$ of $G$ such that $\langle S\rangle=H$.  In particular, $\langle H\rangle=H$.

More coming soon...
