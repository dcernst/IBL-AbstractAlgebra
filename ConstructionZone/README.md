# Warning

During the Spring 2018 semester, I will be making substantial changes to the first few chapters. Comments:

  1. In my view, one of the strengths of my notes is the first few chapters that develop intuition about groups. In my experience, nearly all of the students anticipate and understand the theorems that come after the formal definition of a group because they have tinkered enough with examples (and drawn pictures). However, one drawback is that over the past couple years, the first few chapters have become bloated with every great idea that I’ve had.  A negative consequence of this is that it takes us too long to get through material that most students think is pretty easy, which means we have to go pretty fast at the end when things are much more difficult.
  2. In light of above, I am currently rewriting the first few chapters during the Spring 2018 semester while teaching the course.  The hope is to retain the best of what is the previous versions and get through the intuition developing phase faster. One thing I hope to do is intersperse some of the intuition building stuff amongst the formal stuff.
  3. My plan is to update the version in the ConstructionZone direction as I go.
  4. I think the the version of the notes in the Fall2017 directory is in great shape and I would feel comfortable with anyone using them.  The motivation for the new version is to take the notes to the next level.
  5. Undoubtably, I’ll introduce some errors in the new version that will take an iteration or two to iron out.
  6. If you are planning to use my notes, you can either go with the battle-tested Fall2017 version (which I know a few people are doing) or wait for the new version to be released.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.
